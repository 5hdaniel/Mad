# Code Signing and Notarization Setup

This document explains how to set up code signing and notarization for Audit Magic so that macOS recognizes the app and doesn't block installation.

## Prerequisites

1. **Apple Developer Account** (Required)
   - You need an active Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
   - Sign up at: https://developer.apple.com

2. **Developer ID Certificate**
   - Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list
   - Create a "Developer ID Application" certificate
   - Download and install it in your Keychain

## Step 1: Get Your Apple Credentials

### 1.1 Apple ID
Your Apple Developer account email address.

### 1.2 Team ID
Find your Team ID:
1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account
2. Click "Membership" in the sidebar
3. Your Team ID is listed there (format: `ABC123XYZ`)

### 1.3 App-Specific Password
Generate an app-specific password for notarization:
1. Go to: https://appleid.apple.com
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Under "Security" section, click "App-Specific Passwords"
4. Click "Generate an app-specific password"
5. Give it a name like "Audit Magic Notarization"
6. Copy the password (format: `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`)

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and fill in your credentials:
   ```bash
   # Apple Developer Credentials for Notarization
   APPLE_ID=your-email@example.com
   APPLE_TEAM_ID=ABC123XYZ
   APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

   # Microsoft Graph API (if using Outlook integration)
   MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
   MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID=common
   ```

3. **Important**: Never commit `.env.local` to git! It's already in `.gitignore`.

## Step 3: Build and Package

Run the package command to build, sign, and notarize:
```bash
npm run package
```

The build process will:
1. Build the React app
2. Package the Electron app
3. Sign the app with your Developer ID certificate
4. Upload to Apple for notarization
5. Wait for notarization to complete
6. Staple the notarization ticket to the DMG

This can take 5-15 minutes for notarization.

## Step 4: Verify Notarization

After packaging, verify the app is properly signed and notarized:

```bash
# Check code signature
codesign -dv --verbose=4 dist/mac/Audit\ Magic.app

# Check notarization
spctl -a -vv -t install dist/mac/Audit\ Magic.app

# Check DMG notarization
spctl -a -vv -t open --context context:primary-signature dist/Audit\ Magic-*.dmg
```

You should see:
- `Status: approved` or `accepted`
- `source=Notarized Developer ID`

## Understanding the Configuration

### package.json Build Settings

```json
"build": {
  "appId": "com.auditmagic.app",
  "productName": "Audit Magic",
  "mac": {
    "hardenedRuntime": true,        // Required for notarization
    "gatekeeperAssess": false,      // Don't assess during build
    "entitlements": "build/entitlements.mac.plist",
    "notarize": {
      "teamId": "${APPLE_TEAM_ID}"  // From .env.local
    }
  },
  "afterSign": "scripts/notarize.js"  // Notarization script
}
```

### Entitlements File

The `build/entitlements.mac.plist` file declares required permissions:
- Full Disk Access (for Messages database)
- Contacts access
- Network access (for Outlook)
- Keychain access (for storing credentials)

## Troubleshooting

### "The app can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"

**Cause**: App is not properly signed or notarized.

**Solution**:
1. Verify your Developer ID certificate is installed in Keychain
2. Check that `.env.local` has correct credentials
3. Rebuild with `npm run package`

### Notarization Fails

**Check notarization status**:
```bash
xcrun notarytool history --apple-id "your@email.com" --team-id "ABC123XYZ"
```

**Get detailed error**:
```bash
xcrun notarytool log <submission-id> --apple-id "your@email.com" --team-id "ABC123XYZ"
```

Common issues:
- Incorrect app-specific password → regenerate at appleid.apple.com
- Missing entitlements → check build/entitlements.mac.plist
- Unsigned libraries → check that all dependencies are signed

### "App is damaged and can't be opened"

**Cause**: Quarantine attribute from downloading unsigned app.

**Temporary fix** (for testing only):
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Audit\ Magic.app
```

**Proper fix**: Always download notarized DMG from official source.

## Distribution

### For End Users

**Recommended**: Distribute the notarized DMG file:
- File: `dist/Audit Magic-1.0.3.dmg`
- Users can double-click to install
- macOS will verify notarization automatically

### Auto-Updates

The app includes auto-update functionality via GitHub releases:
1. Tag a release on GitHub
2. Upload the DMG and ZIP files
3. Users will be notified of updates automatically

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never share** your app-specific password
2. **Never commit** `.env.local` to version control
3. **Rotate passwords** periodically
4. **Keep certificates** backed up securely
5. **Test installations** on a clean Mac before distributing
