# Real Estate Archive App

A simple desktop application for exporting iMessage conversations to text files.

## Features

- 📱 Access and export iMessage conversations from your Mac
- 🔍 Search and filter conversations
- 📤 Export multiple conversations at once
- 💾 Save exports as clean, readable text files
- 🎨 Clean, modern UI built with React + Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- macOS (for accessing Messages database)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Add sqlite3 for database access:
```bash
npm install sqlite3
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run package
```

## Permissions

This app requires **Full Disk Access** to read your Messages database.

To grant permissions:
1. Open **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **Privacy**
2. Select **Full Disk Access**
3. Click the **+** button and add the app
4. Restart the app

## How It Works

1. **Permissions Check**: The app verifies it has access to your Messages database
2. **Load Conversations**: Reads your iMessage conversations from `~/Library/Messages/chat.db`
3. **Select & Export**: Choose conversations and export them as formatted text files
4. **Save**: Files are saved to your chosen location

## Tech Stack

- **Electron**: Cross-platform desktop framework
- **React**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling
- **Vite**: Build tool
- **SQLite3**: Database access for Messages

## TypeScript Migration

The codebase has been fully migrated to TypeScript with **strict mode enabled** for maximum type safety:

### Type Safety Features
- ✅ `strict: true` - All strict mode checks enabled
- ✅ `noImplicitAny: true` - No implicit any types
- ✅ `strictNullChecks: true` - Null and undefined handled explicitly
- ✅ 100% type coverage - All files type-checked
- ✅ 0 TypeScript errors

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Type check without building
npm run type-check

# Build Electron files
npm run build:electron

# Build preload script
npm run build:preload

# Full build (React + Electron)
npm run build
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Type checking runs automatically before commits via Husky
- CI/CD pipeline validates types on every push
- Prevents type errors from entering the codebase

### Key Patterns
- **Optional values**: Use `undefined` (not `null`) for optional properties
- **Error handling**: Use `instanceof Error` checks in catch blocks
- **API boundaries**: Convert database `null` values to `undefined` with `?? undefined`
- **Validation**: Non-null assertions (`!`) only used with validation functions that throw on invalid input

## Privacy

- All data stays on your device
- No analytics or tracking
- No cloud uploads (unless you choose to export to cloud storage)
- Open source and transparent

## Troubleshooting

### Architecture Mismatch Error (Apple Silicon)

If you see an error like:
```
Error: dlopen(...node_sqlite3.node, 0x0001): mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have 'x86_64', need 'arm64e' or 'arm64')
```

This means the sqlite3 native module was built for the wrong architecture. This commonly happens when:
- Dependencies were installed on an Intel Mac or using Rosetta
- You're running on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4 Mac)
- Node modules were copied from another machine

**Solution:**

The app includes an automatic rebuild system using `electron-rebuild`. Simply run:
```bash
npm install
```

The `postinstall` script will automatically rebuild all native modules (including sqlite3) for your current architecture and Electron version.

**If the problem persists:**
```bash
# Remove node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

This ensures all native modules are compiled correctly for your system.

## Future Enhancements

- Cloud storage integrations (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- Advanced filtering (date ranges, search)
- Export formats (PDF, CSV)
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux via Android Messages)
- Authentication and subscription features
