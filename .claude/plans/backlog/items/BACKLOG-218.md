## Follow-Up Required

Need to clarify with user:

1. **Current display issues?**
   - Are group chats showing incorrectly?
   - Is the layout confusing?
   - Are participants not visible?

2. **Desired display format?**
   - Show all participants?
   - Group name prominently displayed?
   - Different visual treatment from 1:1 chats?
   - Expandable/collapsible format?

3. **Specific pain points?**
   - Hard to identify which group chat is which?
   - Too much/too little information shown?
   - Need filtering or sorting options?
