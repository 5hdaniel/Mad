# Pull Request Standard Operating Procedure

This document outlines the standard procedure for creating, reviewing, and merging pull requests in Magic Audit. All agents and contributors should follow this SOP.

**LLM Note**: Claude and other AI agents can assist with all phases. Look for 🤖 markers for specific automation opportunities.

## Quick Reference

| PR Type | Target Branch | Merge Type | Required Checks |
|---------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| Feature | `develop` | Traditional | Tests, Security |
| Bug Fix | `develop` | Traditional | Tests, Security |
| Hotfix | `main` + `develop` | Traditional | Tests, Builds, Security |
| Release | `main` (from develop) | Traditional | All checks |

**CRITICAL: Always use traditional merges (not squash) to preserve commit history.**

---

## Phase 0: Target Branch Verification

Before creating a PR, verify you're targeting the correct branch:

| Your Branch Type | Target Branch |
|------------------|---------------|
| `feature/*` | `develop` |
| `fix/*` | `develop` |
| `claude/*` | `develop` |
| `hotfix/*` | `main` AND `develop` |
| `develop` (release) | `main` |

```bash
# Check your current branch
git branch --show-current

# Verify target branch is up to date
git fetch origin
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/develop  # Should be empty or show expected commits
```

---

## Phase 1: Branch Preparation

### 1.1 Sync Branch
Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the target branch:

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/develop  # or origin/main for hotfixes
```

Resolve any merge conflicts before proceeding.

### 1.2 Dependencies & Native Modules

**CRITICAL: Native Module Rebuild Required**

Native modules like `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` must be compiled for Electron's bundled Node.js version (not your system Node.js). This is a common source of "infinite loop" bugs.

**Standard rebuild (try first):**
```bash
npm rebuild better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers
npx electron-rebuild
```

**If standard rebuild doesn't work** (common on Windows without Python):
```powershell
# 1. Clear the prebuild cache (may have wrong version cached)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\npm-cache\_prebuilds"

# 2. Delete the existing build
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "node_modules\better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers\build"

# 3. Download the correct Electron-specific prebuild (replace 35.7.5 with your Electron version)
cd node_modules/better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers
npx prebuild-install --runtime=electron --target=35.7.5 --arch=x64 --platform=win32
```

Check your Electron version with: `npx electron --version`

**Common Error**: If you see `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch errors:
```
NODE_MODULE_VERSION 127. This version of Node.js requires NODE_MODULE_VERSION 133.
```
This means the native module was compiled for Node.js (127 = Node 22.x) but Electron needs a different version (133). Use the prebuild-install fix above.

### 1.3 Verify App Starts
**Before committing**, always verify the app actually runs:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Check for:
- [ ] No `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` errors in console
- [ ] Database initializes successfully
- [ ] App doesn't get stuck on loading/onboarding screens

---

## Phase 2: Code Cleanup

### 2.1 Remove Debug Code
Search for and remove:
- [ ] `console.log` statements (except structured logging)
- [ ] `console.warn` / `console.error` (unless intentional)
- [ ] Commented-out code blocks
- [ ] Unused imports
- [ ] Dead code / unreachable code
- [ ] TODO comments that should be resolved

```bash
# Find console statements
grep -rn "console\." src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
```

🤖 **LLM Assist**: Use ESLint autofix, codemods, or ask Claude to identify and remove debug code.

### 2.2 Style & Formatting
- [ ] Run Prettier/formatter
- [ ] Verify naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- [ ] Check file structure alignment with project standards

```bash
npm run lint -- --fix
```

🤖 **LLM Assist**: Claude can propose consistent patterns and refactors for naming/structure.

### 2.3 Structured Error Logging
Use the appropriate logger for each process:

**Electron main process:** `LogService` (`electron/services/logService.ts`)
**Renderer process:** `logger` (`src/utils/logger.ts`)

- [ ] Use appropriate log levels: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`
- [ ] Include context in log messages (function name, relevant IDs)
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs (tokens, passwords, PII)
- [ ] Use structured metadata for additional context

```typescript
// Electron main process
import logService from './logService';
logService.info('Processing transaction', 'TransactionService');

// Renderer process
import logger from '@/utils/logger';
logger.info('Sync started', { transactionId: '123' });
```

🤖 **LLM Assist**: Claude can generate consistent, standardized log statements using the LogService pattern.

### 2.4 React Effect Anti-Patterns

Check for these common patterns that cause infinite loops or lost navigation:

#### Callback Effects Must Use Ref Guards
Any `useEffect` that calls a prop callback (e.g., `onXChange`, `onComplete`, `onUpdate`) MUST track the last-reported value:

```typescript
// BAD - causes infinite loops if parent re-renders on callback
useEffect(() => {
  onValueChange?.(value);
}, [value, onValueChange]);

// GOOD - ref guard prevents duplicate calls
const lastValueRef = useRef<typeof value | null>(null);
useEffect(() => {
  if (onValueChange && lastValueRef.current !== value) {
    lastValueRef.current = value;
    onValueChange(value);
  }
}, [value, onValueChange]);
```

- [ ] All `useEffect` callbacks use ref guards

#### Empty State Must Navigate (Not Return Null)
Flow/wizard components that can have zero steps must actively navigate:

```typescript
// BAD - component returns null but user is stuck
if (steps.length === 0) return null;

// GOOD - actively navigates when nothing to show
useEffect(() => {
  if (steps.length === 0) app.goToStep("dashboard");
}, [steps.length, app]);
```

- [ ] Flow components navigate on empty state (not just return null)

#### Related Booleans Checked Together
When checking completion flags, ensure ALL semantically-related states are considered:

```typescript
// BAD - incomplete check
const needsEmailOnboarding = !hasCompletedEmailOnboarding;

// GOOD - checks both completion flag AND actual state
const needsEmailOnboarding = !hasCompletedEmailOnboarding && !hasEmailConnected;
```

- [ ] Related boolean flags are checked together

🤖 **LLM Assist**: Claude can audit useEffect patterns and identify missing ref guards or incomplete conditionals.

---

## Phase 3: Security & Documentation

### 3.1 Security Scan
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or tokens
- [ ] No sensitive data in error messages or logs
- [ ] Input validation on user inputs
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention in React components

```bash
# Check for potential secrets
grep -rn "password\|secret\|api_key\|token" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "type\|interface"
```

🤖 **LLM Assist**: Claude can spot security smells and recommend fixes. Also consider tools like gitleaks, truffleHog, or git-secrets.

### 3.2 Documentation Updates
If applicable, update:
- [ ] README.md sections affected by new features
- [ ] Code comments for complex logic
- [ ] Type definitions
- [ ] .env.example for new environment variables
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger JSON if endpoints were added

🤖 **LLM Assist**: Claude can draft README updates, code comments, and documentation for new features.

---

## Phase 4: Testing

### 4.1 Mock Data & Fixtures
- [ ] Test mocks match current API/schema
- [ ] Fixtures are up-to-date
- [ ] No hardcoded test data that could become stale

🤖 **LLM Assist**: Claude can generate fixture JSON, mock data, and update test fixtures to match new schemas.

### 4.2 Automated Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for new functions/utilities
- [ ] Integration tests for new features
- [ ] Component tests for UI changes
- [ ] Snapshot tests (if applicable)
- [ ] Target coverage: 40-80%

🤖 **LLM Assist**: Claude can generate test boilerplate, write full unit tests, and suggest edge cases to cover.

### 4.3 Test Suite Execution
Run the full test suite locally:

```bash
npm test
```

All tests must pass. No skipped tests without justification.

🤖 **LLM Assist**: If tests fail, Claude can analyze failures and suggest fixes.

---

## Phase 5: Static Analysis

### 5.1 Type Check
```bash
npm run type-check
```
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No `any` types without justification

### 5.2 Lint Check
```bash
npm run lint
```
- [ ] No lint errors (warnings acceptable with justification)

### 5.3 Performance Check
Review for:
- [ ] Unnecessary re-renders in React components
- [ ] Missing memoization for expensive computations
- [ ] O(n²) or worse algorithmic complexity
- [ ] Large bundle size additions
- [ ] Inefficient database queries
- [ ] Inefficient use of state or APIs

🤖 **LLM Assist**: Claude can spot performance issues and generate optimization suggestions without manual benchmarking.

---

## Phase 6: Final Automated Code Review

**This is a critical quality gate.** Run the entire branch through Claude to check for:

### 6.1 Code Quality Issues
- [ ] Anti-patterns and code smells
- [ ] Missing error checks / error handling
- [ ] Duplicate logic that should be abstracted
- [ ] Unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Missing null-checks / undefined handling
- [ ] Inconsistent naming conventions
- [ ] Code that needs refactoring
- [ ] **Optional props with silent failures** - verify all interface props are passed from parent components (see "Common Issues" section)

### 6.2 Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Entry file guardrails respected (App.tsx < 70 lines)
- [ ] Business logic not in entry files
- [ ] IPC boundaries respected (main/preload/renderer)
- [ ] Service abstractions used (no direct `window.api` in components)

### 6.3 Review Prompt Template

Use this prompt to request a code review:

```
Please review this branch for PR readiness. Check for:
1. Anti-patterns and code smells
2. Missing error handling
3. Duplicate logic
4. Unnecessary complexity
5. Missing null-checks
6. Inconsistent naming
7. Architecture boundary violations
8. Performance issues
9. Security concerns

Provide specific file:line references and suggested fixes.
```

🤖 **LLM Assist**: This phase replaces manual pre-review and significantly increases PR quality.

---

## Phase 7: PR Creation

### 7.1 Commit History
- [ ] Commits are atomic and focused
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format:
  - `feat:` - New feature
  - `fix:` - Bug fix
  - `docs:` - Documentation
  - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
  - `test:` - Adding tests
  - `chore:` - Maintenance

### 7.2 Create PR

```bash
git push -u origin your-branch-name

gh pr create --base develop --title "type: description" --body "..."
```

🤖 **LLM Assist**: Claude can draft PR descriptions based on the changes made.

### 7.3 PR Description Template

```markdown
## Summary
- Bullet points describing what this PR does

## Changes
- List of specific changes made

## Test Plan
- [ ] How to test this change
- [ ] What was tested

## Screenshots (if UI changes)
[Add screenshots here]

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Type check passes
- [ ] Lint check passes
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
```

---

## Phase 7.5: MANDATORY Sync with Target Branch

**⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE: Always merge the target branch INTO your feature branch before final CI run.**

This step MUST be performed before pushing for final CI verification:

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest from target branch
git fetch origin

# 2. Merge target branch into your feature branch
git merge origin/develop  # or origin/main for hotfixes

# 3. If conflicts exist, resolve them NOW
# 4. Run tests locally to verify nothing broke
npm run type-check
npm test

# 5. Push (this triggers CI on the merged state)
git push
```

**Why this is mandatory:**
- Other PRs may have been merged since you started
- Merge conflicts caught BEFORE merge to develop, not after
- CI runs against the FINAL merged state
- Prevents broken `develop` branch from conflicting changes

**If conflicts exist:**
1. Resolve them in your feature branch
2. Test locally
3. Push the resolution
4. CI will run on the conflict-resolved code

**DO NOT skip this step even if:**
- Your PR was just created
- CI already passed once before
- You think develop hasn't changed

---

## Phase 8: CI Verification

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Never claim CI passed without explicit verification. False CI claims waste user time and erode trust.**

### 8.1 Wait for ALL Checks to Complete

Use `--watch` to block until all checks finish:

```bash
# REQUIRED: Wait for all checks to complete (blocks until done)
gh pr checks <PR-NUMBER> --watch
```

**DO NOT** use `gh pr checks` without `--watch` and assume checks passed - they may still be running.

### 8.2 Verify ALL Jobs Passed

After checks complete, verify EVERY job shows `pass`:

| Check | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Test & Lint (macOS) | Yes | Unit tests + linting |
| Test & Lint (Windows) | Yes | Cross-platform verification |
| Security Audit | Yes | npm audit |
| Build Application | Yes | Vite + Electron build |
| Package Application | develop/main only | Creates DMG/NSIS installers |

```bash
# Verify all checks passed (should show all green checkmarks)
gh pr checks <PR-NUMBER>

# For develop/main PRs, also check the Package Application step explicitly
gh run list --branch <BRANCH-NAME> --limit 5
gh run view <RUN-ID>  # Check Package Application job status
```

### 8.3 Special Attention: Package Application

**The Package Application job only runs on `develop` and `main` branches.** This means:

1. **Feature branch PRs** - Package job doesn't run. CI may pass on feature branch but fail after merge.
2. **After merging to develop** - ALWAYS verify Package Application succeeded:
   ```bash
   # Check the develop branch CI after merge
   gh run list --branch develop --limit 3
   gh run view <LATEST-RUN-ID>
   ```

### 8.4 LLM Guardrails (for Claude and AI agents)

When verifying CI status, you MUST:

1. **Run `gh pr checks --watch`** and wait for it to complete (don't interrupt)
2. **Include the actual command output** in your response to the user
3. **Check all jobs** - if any show `fail` or `pending`, CI has NOT passed
4. **After merge to develop/main**, verify Package Application job separately
5. **Never say "CI passed"** without showing evidence from `gh pr checks` or `gh run view`

**Example verification response:**
```
CI Status for PR #114:
✓ Test & Lint (macos-latest, 20.x)  pass
✓ Test & Lint (windows-latest, 20.x)  pass
✓ Build Application (macos-latest)  pass
✓ Build Application (windows-latest)  pass
✓ Security Audit  pass

All 5 checks passed. Ready to merge.
```

**If Package Application needs verification (after merge to develop):**
```bash
gh run list --branch develop --limit 1
# Then check that specific run
gh run view <RUN-ID>
```

---

## Phase 9: Merge

**CRITICAL: Creating a PR is step 3 of 4, not the final step. The task is NOT complete until the PR is MERGED.**

**Full lifecycle reference:** `.claude/docs/shared/pr-lifecycle.md`

### Pre-Merge Checklist
- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] No merge conflicts (verified in Phase 7.5)
- [ ] PR approved (if reviews required)
- [ ] Target branch is correct

### 9.1 Merge Command

```bash
# ALWAYS use traditional merge (--merge), NEVER squash
# Do NOT auto-delete branches - deletion is a separate, manual step
gh pr merge <PR-NUMBER> --merge
```

**Branch Deletion:** See `.claude/docs/shared/git-branching.md` for deletion policy. Do NOT use `--delete-branch` unless explicitly requested.

### 9.2 Merge Verification (MANDATORY)

**After running the merge command, you MUST verify the merge succeeded.**

```bash
# Verify merge state - MUST show "MERGED"
gh pr view <PR-NUMBER> --json state --jq '.state'
```

| Result | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `MERGED` | Success - task can be marked complete | Proceed to Post-Merge |
| `OPEN` | Merge failed or didn't run | Investigate and retry |
| `CLOSED` | PR was closed without merge | Work is LOST - investigate |

**Do NOT mark the task as complete until you see `MERGED`.**

### 9.3 Post-Merge
- [ ] Verify merge completed: `gh pr view <PR> --json state` shows `MERGED`
- [ ] Delete local branch: `git branch -d your-branch-name`
- [ ] Pull latest changes: `git checkout develop && git pull`
- [ ] Update task file with completion status
- [ ] Notify PM that task is complete (only AFTER merge verified)

### 9.5 Debugging Metrics Verification (MANDATORY)

Before merging, SR Engineer MUST verify debugging metrics are accurately captured.

**Goal:** Capture ALL debugging for estimation accuracy, block only on clear discrepancies.

**Step 1: Collect evidence**
```bash
# Count fix commits
FIX_COUNT=$(git log --oneline origin/develop..HEAD | grep -iE "fix" | wc -l)
echo "Fix commits: $FIX_COUNT"

# Check PR age
gh pr view --json createdAt --jq '.createdAt'
```

**Step 2: Tiered response based on evidence vs reported**

| Fix Commits | Debugging Reported | Response |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| 0 | 0 | PASS |
| 0 | >0 | PASS (honest about investigation time) |
| 1-2 | 0 | ASK engineer: "These fix commits took 0 debugging time?" |
| 1-2 | >0 | PASS |
| 3-5 | 0 | BLOCK - Require metrics update before merge |
| 3-5 | >0 | PASS (verify roughly proportional) |
| 6+ | any | INCIDENT REPORT required |

**Step 3: Timeline as signal (not blocker)**

PR open time does not equal work time. Engineers wait for CI, answers, dependencies.

**If PR >4h AND Debugging: 0, ASK:**
- "Was there waiting time (CI, blocked, waiting for answer)?"
- "Were there any unexpected issues that required debugging?"
- "Did investigation/troubleshooting happen that didn't result in fix commits?"

**Only block if:** fix commits present + Debugging: 0 (clear discrepancy)

**Why this matters:** Without accurate debugging metrics, PM estimates appear more accurate than they are. Even 10 minutes of debugging affects estimation calibration.

**Reference:** BACKLOG-126 (TASK-704 incident - 22h debugging reported as 0)

---

## Hotfix Procedure

For urgent production fixes:

```bash
# 1. Branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/description

# 2. Make fix and test

# 3. Create PR to main
gh pr create --base main --title "hotfix: description"

# 4. After merge to main, also merge to develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge origin/main
git push origin develop
```

---

## CI Failure Recovery

If CI fails after creating the PR:

1. **Check the failing job logs** on GitHub Actions
2. **Run the failing check locally** to reproduce
3. **Fix the issue**
4. **Re-run the checklist** starting from the earliest relevant phase:
   - Type error → Phase 5.1
   - Lint error → Phase 5.2
   - Test failure → Phase 4.3
   - Security issue → Phase 3.1
5. **Push the fix** and wait for CI to re-run

🤖 **LLM Assist**: Claude can analyze CI failure logs and suggest fixes.

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Native Module Mismatch
```bash
npm rebuild better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers
npx electron-rebuild
```

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/develop
# Resolve conflicts in editor
git add .
git commit
```

### CI Failures
1. Check the failing job logs on GitHub Actions
2. Run the failing check locally
3. Fix and push

### Optional Props with Silent Failures (Component Refactoring Bug)

**Pattern**: When extracting components during refactoring, optional props (`prop?: type`) can be defined in the interface but never passed from the parent. This causes **silent failures** - the UI renders, buttons appear clickable, but handlers do nothing.

**Example** (from commit `3b481ef` - EmailOnboardingScreen bug):
```tsx
// Interface defines optional props:
interface EmailOnboardingScreenProps {
  selectedPhoneType?: "iphone" | "android";  // Optional - no compile error if missing
  onPhoneTypeChange?: (type: "iphone" | "android") => void;  // Silent failure
  onBack?: () => void;  // Back button breaks silently
}

// Parent component never passes them:
<EmailOnboardingScreen
  userId={...}
  authProvider={...}
  onComplete={handleEmailOnboardingComplete}
  // selectedPhoneType - MISSING! No compile error
  // onPhoneTypeChange - MISSING! Buttons do nothing
  // onBack - MISSING! Back button appears but fails silently
/>
```

**Prevention Checklist** (add to Phase 6.1):
- [ ] When extracting/refactoring components, verify ALL props in the interface are passed from parent
- [ ] Pay special attention to optional props (`?`) - they won't cause compile errors when missing
- [ ] Test interactive elements (buttons, selects) actually trigger their handlers
- [ ] Check that state flows bidirectionally (parent → child AND child → parent)

**Detection**:
```bash
# Find optional props in component interfaces that might be missing
grep -rn "?: .*=>.*void" src/components --include="*.tsx"
```

---

## Session-End Checklist (MANDATORY)

**Before ending ANY working session, verify no orphaned PRs exist.**

> **Incident Reference:** SPRINT-051/052 had 20+ orphaned PRs that were created but never merged, causing fixes to be "lost" and reimplemented multiple times.

### Quick Verification

```bash
# Check for any open PRs you created
gh pr list --state open --author @me

# Check for any sprint-related open PRs
gh pr list --state open --search "TASK-"
```

### For Each Open PR Found

| PR State | Action Required |
|----------|-----------------|
| CI failing | Fix before ending session OR document blocker |
| Awaiting review | Note for next session (acceptable) |
| Approved but not merged | **MERGE NOW** - do not leave approved PRs unmerged |
| Has merge conflicts | Resolve before ending session |

### Session-End Checklist

Copy this to your notes:

```markdown
## Before Ending Session

- [ ] `gh pr list --state open --author @me` - reviewed all open PRs
- [ ] All approved PRs have been merged
- [ ] All merges verified with `gh pr view <PR> --json state`
- [ ] No PRs with failing CI left unattended (or blocker documented)
- [ ] Task files updated with merge confirmations
```

**Do NOT end a session with approved-but-unmerged PRs.**
