# Engineer Workflow Checklist

**MANDATORY**: Follow these steps for every task. Each agent step requires recording the Agent ID for metrics collection.

## Quick Reference: 5-Step Task Cycle

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**CRITICAL:**
- Each agent invocation MUST record its Agent ID immediately
- NO implementation before Steps 1-3 complete
- User approval is a BLOCKING gate

## Agent ID Tracking Table (Per Task)

**Copy this to your task file and fill in as you progress:**

| Step | Agent Type | Agent ID | Tokens | Status |
|------|------------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1. Plan | Plan Agent | ___________ | ___K | ☐ |
| 2. SR Review | SR Engineer Agent | ___________ | ___K | ☐ |
| 3. User Review | (No agent) | N/A | N/A | ☐ |
| 4. Compact | (Context reset) | N/A | N/A | ☐ |
| 5. Implement | Engineer Agent | ___________ | ___K | ☐ |

**After task completion, collect metrics:**
```bash
grep "<plan_agent_id>" .claude/metrics/tokens.csv
grep "<sr_engineer_agent_id>" .claude/metrics/tokens.csv
grep "<engineer_agent_id>" .claude/metrics/tokens.csv
```

---

## Pre-Work: Create Branch

**Before starting the 5-step cycle:**

```bash
# Always start from the sprint branch (or develop)
git checkout project/licensing-and-auth-flow  # or develop
git pull origin project/licensing-and-auth-flow

# Create feature branch with task ID
git checkout -b feature/task-XXX-description
```

**Naming Convention:**
- `fix/task-XXX-...` for bug fixes
- `feature/task-XXX-...` for new features
- `claude/task-XXX-...` for AI-assisted work

---

## Step 1: PLAN (Plan Agent)

**Purpose:** Create a detailed implementation plan before any code is written.

**Who:** Plan Agent (invoke via Task tool with `subagent_type="Plan"`)

**Actions:**
1. Read the task file (`.claude/plans/tasks/TASK-XXX.md`)
2. Explore relevant codebase files
3. Identify all files to modify/create
4. Create step-by-step implementation plan
5. Document any risks or concerns

**Deliverable:** Implementation plan written to task file or separate plan file

**IMMEDIATELY RECORD:**
```
Plan Agent ID: <agent_id from Task tool output>
```

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Plan covers all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Files to modify are identified
- [ ] Risks are documented
- [ ] Plan Agent ID recorded

---

## Step 2: SR REVIEW (SR Engineer Agent)

**Purpose:** Technical validation of the plan before user review.

**Who:** SR Engineer Agent (invoke via Task tool with `subagent_type="senior-engineer-pr-lead"`)

**Actions:**
1. Review the implementation plan from Step 1
2. Validate architectural approach
3. Check for security concerns
4. Verify plan aligns with codebase patterns
5. Approve or request changes

**IMMEDIATELY RECORD:**
```
SR Engineer Agent ID: <agent_id from Task tool output>
```

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Plan technically validated
- [ ] No architectural concerns
- [ ] SR Engineer Agent ID recorded
- [ ] SR approval documented

---

## Step 3: USER REVIEW (Blocking Gate)

**Purpose:** User approves the plan before any implementation begins.

**Who:** User (human)

**Actions:**
1. Present plan to user
2. Explain approach and any tradeoffs
3. Answer user questions
4. Get explicit approval

**⚠️ BLOCKING GATE:**
- Do NOT proceed to Step 4 without user approval
- If user requests changes, go back to Step 1

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] User has reviewed the plan
- [ ] User has explicitly approved
- [ ] Any user feedback incorporated

---

## Step 4: COMPACT (Context Reset)

**Purpose:** Reset context for clean implementation with fresh token budget.

**Who:** System (user triggers `/compact` or starts new session)

**Actions:**
1. User runs `/compact` command OR
2. User starts a new Claude session
3. Implementation begins with fresh context

**Why Compact?**
- Planning and review consume tokens
- Fresh context = more tokens for implementation
- Reduces confusion from planning exploration

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Context compacted or new session started
- [ ] Ready for implementation

---

## Step 5: IMPLEMENT (Engineer Agent)

**Purpose:** Execute the approved plan.

**Who:** Engineer Agent (invoke via Task tool with `subagent_type="engineer"`)

**Actions:**
1. Read the approved plan
2. Implement exactly as specified
3. Run tests: `npm test`
4. Run type check: `npm run type-check`
5. Run lint: `npm run lint`
6. Create PR
7. Wait for CI
8. Request SR review for merge
9. Merge and verify

**IMMEDIATELY RECORD:**
```
Engineer Agent ID: <agent_id from Task tool output>
```

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Code implemented per plan
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] PR created and merged
- [ ] Engineer Agent ID recorded

**STOP if you encounter blockers** - ask PM before proceeding.

---

## Step 6: PM UPDATE (After Task Completion)

**Purpose:** PM updates tracking files after task passes testing and is merged.

**Who:** PM Agent or PM (human)

**Actions:**
1. Update sprint plan status (task marked complete)
2. Update backlog CSV (BACKLOG-XXX status)
3. Record actual metrics vs estimates
4. Log metrics to `tokens.csv`

**Files Updated:**
- `.claude/plans/sprints/SPRINT-XXX.md` - Task status → Complete
- `.claude/backlog/backlog.csv` - Item status → Done
- `.claude/metrics/tokens.csv` - Actual token usage logged

**PM Metrics to Record:**

| Metric | Source | Location |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Plan Agent tokens | `grep "<plan_agent_id>" tokens.csv` | Sprint plan |
| SR Review tokens | `grep "<sr_agent_id>" tokens.csv` | Sprint plan |
| Engineer tokens | `grep "<engineer_agent_id>" tokens.csv` | Sprint plan |
| Total task tokens | Sum of above | Sprint plan |
| Variance | Estimated vs Actual | Sprint plan |

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Sprint plan updated with task completion
- [ ] Backlog CSV updated
- [ ] Metrics logged and variance calculated

---

## Implementation Details (Within Step 5)

The following details apply during Step 5 (IMPLEMENT):

### PR Creation

**Only create PR when:**
- [ ] Code implemented per approved plan
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Type check passes
- [ ] Lint passes

**Create PR:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "type(scope): description

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

git push -u origin your-branch-name
gh pr create --base project/licensing-and-auth-flow --title "..." --body "..."
```

### CI and Debug Failures

1. **Wait for CI to complete:**
   ```bash
   gh pr checks <PR-NUMBER> --watch
   ```

2. **If CI fails - Debug and Fix:**
   ```bash
   gh run view <RUN-ID> --log-failed
   ```
   - Test failures → Run `npm test` locally, fix, push
   - Type errors → Run `npm run type-check`, fix, push
   - Lint errors → Run `npm run lint --fix`, commit, push

3. **Once ALL checks pass, request SR review for merge:**
   - Use the `senior-engineer-pr-lead` agent
   - This is a PR review, different from the plan review in Step 2

### Merge and Verify

**CRITICAL: A PR is NOT complete until MERGED.**

```bash
# Merge after SR approval
gh pr merge <PR-NUMBER> --merge

# Verify merge state - MUST show "MERGED"
gh pr view <PR-NUMBER> --json state --jq '.state'
```

| Result | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `MERGED` | Success - notify PM | Proceed to Step 6 |
| `OPEN` | Merge failed | Investigate and retry |
| `CLOSED` | PR closed without merge | Work is LOST - escalate |

### Session-End Check

Before ending any session:
```bash
gh pr list --state open --author @me
```

If any approved PRs are still open, merge them NOW.

---

## Parallel Task Execution

Sometimes PM will assign multiple tasks to run in parallel. This is only safe when SR Engineer has reviewed and approved parallel execution.

### Recommended: Git Worktree Pattern

**SPRINT-009 Lesson:** Git worktrees work well for parallel independent tasks. Each worktree is a separate working directory with its own branch, preventing conflicts.

**Setup (one-time):**
```bash
# From main repository
cd /path/to/Mad

# Create worktrees for parallel tasks
git worktree add ../Mad-TASK-601 feature/TASK-601-description
git worktree add ../Mad-TASK-602 feature/TASK-602-description
```

**Benefits:**
- Isolated working directories (no uncommitted file conflicts)
- Each worktree has its own branch
- Can run parallel Claude sessions, one per worktree
- Git handles tracking automatically

**Cleanup after merge:**
```bash
git worktree remove ../Mad-TASK-601
git worktree remove ../Mad-TASK-602
```

### When You're Assigned Parallel Tasks

**You will be told explicitly:**
```
Parallel Assignment: TASK-XXX and TASK-YYY
These tasks are approved for parallel execution.
Create separate branches for each.
Use worktrees for isolation (recommended).
```

**Rules for parallel work:**
1. Each task gets its own branch (from develop)
2. Use worktrees for isolation (recommended)
3. Do NOT modify files that aren't listed in your task
4. If you discover shared file needs, STOP and notify PM
5. Submit PRs independently - don't wait for the other task

### When Parallel Goes Wrong

**Warning signs:**
- You need to modify a file not in your task scope
- Git shows conflicts when you pull develop
- Another task's PR merged changes you depend on

**If this happens:**
1. STOP work immediately
2. Notify PM: "Parallel conflict detected"
3. Wait for PM/SR guidance on resolution

### Why Same-Session Parallel Can Fail

When two agents run in the **same Claude Code session**, they share:
- The same working directory
- The same uncommitted file state

**What happens:**
1. Agent A writes to `databaseService.ts` (uncommitted)
2. Agent B reads `databaseService.ts` - sees A's uncommitted changes
3. Agent B tries to edit - conflicts with A's version
4. Both agents re-read/re-write in a loop, burning tokens

**This is NOT a git branch problem** - branches only matter at commit/merge time.

**Safe parallel requires:**
- Separate working directories (different terminal sessions)
- OR truly isolated files (no overlap)
- OR sequential execution with commits between tasks

### Token Burn Early Warning

If a parallel task exceeds **2x estimated tokens** in first 10% of work:
- This may indicate agent conflict (shared file loop)
- Notify PM immediately
- Do not continue burning tokens hoping it resolves

## What NOT To Do

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Skip branch creation | Makes tracking and rollback impossible |
| Forget to track metrics | PM needs data for estimation calibration |
| Create PR without metrics | SR Engineer will block it |
| Merge your own PR | Only SR Engineer merges |
| Start next task without PM | PM assigns based on priorities |
| Modify files outside task scope | Can cause parallel conflicts |
| Continue when tokens exceed 2x estimate | Early warning of problems |

## Enforcement Mechanisms

This workflow is **technically enforced** through multiple mechanisms:

### 1. Blocking Gates

| Gate | Enforced By | Cannot Proceed Without |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| Step 1 → Step 2 | System | Plan Agent ID recorded |
| Step 2 → Step 3 | SR Engineer | SR approval documented |
| Step 3 → Step 4 | User | Explicit user approval |
| Step 5 → Step 6 | System | PR merged (state = MERGED) |

### 2. Agent ID Verification

All three Agent IDs (Plan, SR Review, Implement) must be recorded:

| Check | When Verified | Consequence if Missing |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| Plan Agent ID | Before Step 2 | SR Engineer blocks review |
| SR Engineer Agent ID | Before Step 3 | User gate blocked |
| Engineer Agent ID | Before Step 6 | PM rejects task completion |

### 3. CI Validation (Automated)

The `pr-metrics-check.yml` workflow validates PRs:

| Check | Validation | Failure Action |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| Agent ID Summary table | Must be present | PR blocked |
| All three Agent IDs | Must be filled (not blank) | PR blocked |
| Variance calculation | Must be present | PR blocked |

### 4. Workflow Violations

| Violation | Detection Method | Consequence |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Skipped Step 1 (Plan) | Missing Plan Agent ID | PR rejected |
| Skipped Step 2 (SR Review) | Missing SR Agent ID | User gate blocked |
| Skipped Step 3 (User Review) | No user approval | Implementation blocked |
| Missing Agent IDs | CI/SR check | PR rejected |
| Incomplete metrics | PM review | Task not marked complete |

### 5. Violation Recovery

If you violate the workflow:

1. **Skipped Plan step:**
   - STOP implementation
   - Invoke Plan agent retroactively
   - Document as "DEVIATION: Plan created post-implementation"
   - Include retroactive Plan Agent ID

2. **Skipped SR Review:**
   - STOP and invoke SR Engineer for plan review
   - Document deviation

3. **Missing Agent IDs:**
   - Check `.claude/metrics/tokens.csv` for session IDs
   - Document estimation method in notes

4. **CI Blocking PR:**
   - Update PR description with Agent ID Summary table
   - Push any additional commits
   - Wait for CI to re-run
