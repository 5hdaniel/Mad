## 2.5 Unplanned Work Analysis

**CRITICAL**: This section captures work that was NOT in the original sprint plan but was added during execution.

### Unplanned Tasks

| Task | Source | Root Cause | Est. Tokens | Actual Tokens | Impact |
|------|--------|------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| TASK-XXX | <where discovered> | <why not planned> | ~XK | ~YK | +X/-Y lines |
| TASK-XXX | <where discovered> | <why not planned> | ~XK | ~YK | +X/-Y lines |

### Unplanned Work Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Unplanned tasks | X (Y% of total) |
| Unplanned PRs | X (Y% of total) |
| Unplanned lines changed | +X/-Y |
| Unplanned tokens (est) | ~XK |
| Unplanned tokens (actual) | ~YK |
| Discovery buffer | X% |

### Root Cause Distribution

| Category | Count | % of Unplanned | Key Examples |
|----------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| Integration gaps | X | Y% | <example: state machine not wired> |
| Validation discoveries | X | Y% | <example: edge case in testing> |
| Review findings | X | Y% | <example: SR Engineer found issue> |
| Dependency discoveries | X | Y% | <example: Task A needs Task B first> |
| Scope expansion | X | Y% | <example: feature needs more cases> |

### Discovery Buffer Trend

| Sprint | Planned Tasks | Unplanned Tasks | Discovery Buffer |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| SPRINT-XXX | X | Y | Z% |
| SPRINT-XXX | X | Y | Z% |
| **Average** | - | - | **Z%** |

**Recommendation for Future Sprints:**
- If discovery buffer > 30%: Reduce planned scope by 20%
- If discovery buffer > 50%: Reduce planned scope by 30%
- Current trend suggests: <recommendation>
