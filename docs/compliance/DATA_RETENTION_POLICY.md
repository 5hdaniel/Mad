## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This Data Retention Policy establishes the periods for which Magic Audit retains different categories of data, the methods used for secure deletion, and the legal basis for each retention period. This policy ensures compliance with applicable privacy regulations while meeting legitimate business and legal requirements.

### 1.2 Scope

This policy applies to all data collected, processed, and stored by Magic Audit, including:
- Data stored locally on user devices (SQLite database)
- Data synchronized to cloud infrastructure (Supabase)
- Data processed through third-party integrations (Google, Microsoft)
- Backup and archive data
- Logs and analytics data

### 1.3 Principles

- **Data Minimization**: Retain only data necessary for stated purposes
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for purposes disclosed at collection
- **Storage Limitation**: Delete data when retention period expires
- **Security**: Protect data throughout its lifecycle
- **Transparency**: Clearly communicate retention practices to users
