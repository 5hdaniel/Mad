# TASK-1901: Fix npm audit vulnerabilities

## Task Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Task ID** | TASK-1901 |
| **Sprint** | SPRINT-071 |
| **Priority** | P1 - High |
| **Status** | Pending |
| **Estimated Tokens** | ~8K |
| **Depends On** | TASK-1900 |

## Security Context

**Issue:** HIGH-001-004 - Dependabot vulnerabilities

After Next.js upgrade in TASK-1900, remaining vulnerabilities to address:

| Package | Severity | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| glob (via @next/eslint-plugin-next) | High | Command injection via -c/--cmd |

## Requirements

### Must Do

1. Run `npm audit` to identify remaining vulnerabilities
2. For each vulnerability:
   - If `npm audit fix` can resolve it safely, apply the fix
   - If semver-major update required, evaluate breaking changes
3. Document any vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed and why

### Verification Steps

1. **Audit Check:**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   ```
   Target: No high or critical vulnerabilities.

2. **Build Test:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Must complete without errors.

3. **Lint Test:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   Must pass (ESLint config may have changed).

## Expected Resolution

The glob vulnerability is in `@next/eslint-plugin-next` which is a dev dependency:
- Only affects the CLI tool, not runtime
- Should be resolved by eslint-config-next 14.2.35 (already upgraded in TASK-1900)
- If not, may need manual resolution

## Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `package.json` | Any additional dependency updates |
| `package-lock.json` | Regenerated by npm |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `npm audit` shows no high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] OR vulnerabilities are documented as dev-only with acceptable risk
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] Application functionality unchanged

## Branch Information

**Branch From:** `sprint/071-security-fixes` (after TASK-1900 merged)
**Branch Into:** `sprint/071-security-fixes`
**Branch Name:** `fix/TASK-1901-npm-audit`
