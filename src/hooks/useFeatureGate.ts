/**
 * useFeatureGate Hook
 * SPRINT-122: Plan Admin + Feature Gate Enforcement
 *
 * Provides feature access checks in the renderer process.
 * Loads all features on mount and provides an isAllowed() helper.
 *
 * Design:
 * - Fetches all features once on mount
 * - Defaults to allowed for unknown features (fail-open)
 * - Loading state prevents blocking UI
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const { isAllowed, loading } = useFeatureGate();
 *
 * if (!loading && !isAllowed("text_export")) {
 *   return <UpgradePrompt featureName="Text Export" />;
 * }
 * ```
